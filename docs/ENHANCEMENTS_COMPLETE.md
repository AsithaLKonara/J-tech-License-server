## ✅ Enhancement 1: Progressive Frame Loading

**Status:** ✅ **Complete**

### Implementation Details

- **Lowered Threshold:** Progressive loading now activates for patterns with >1000 frames (previously >5000)
- **Adaptive Cache Size:** Cache size adapts based on pattern size (50-100 frames)
- **Integration:** Fully integrated into PreviewTab and EnhancedLEDSimulator
- **Features:**
  - On-demand frame loading during scrubbing
  - Preloading of nearby frames for smooth navigation
  - LRU cache with automatic eviction
  - Memory-efficient for large patterns

### Files Modified:
- `ui/tabs/preview_tab.py` - Lowered threshold, better integration
- `ui/widgets/enhanced_led_simulator.py` - Added lazy loader support
- `core/lazy_frame_loader.py` - Already existed, now better utilized

### Benefits:
- ✅ Faster startup for large patterns
- ✅ Reduced memory usage
- ✅ Smooth scrubbing experience
- ✅ Better performance on systems with limited RAM
