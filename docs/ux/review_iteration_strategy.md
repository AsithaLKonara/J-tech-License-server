# Stakeholder Review & Iteration Strategy

## Review Cadence

- Bi-weekly design review with UX/product/engineering.  
- Demo at end of each phase (timeline, playback, theming).  
- Weekly beta tester sync during program.

## Feedback Channels

- In-app feedback button with issue template.  
- Slack/Discord channel for power users.  
- Post-release SUS/NPS survey.

## Iteration Process

1. Collect feedback/telemetry → triage.  
2. Update backlog tagging component area.  
3. Prioritise in sprint planning; track design debt.  
4. After fixes, run targeted usability/heuristic check.

## Documentation

- Maintain UX changelog in `/docs/ux/changelog.md`.  
- Update component specs and tokens per release.  
- Archive superseded designs for traceability.

## Risk Monitoring

- Escalate unresolved usability blockers within a sprint.  
- Monitor performance KPIs; trigger review if metrics regress.  
- Increase support coverage during major releases.
