# UX Research & Inspiration Summary

## Competitive Audit

| Product | Strengths | Gaps |
| ------- | --------- | ---- |
| LEDMatrix Studio | Fast frame editing, clear thumbnails, quick preview. | Minimal layers, dated theme. |
| Glediator | Robust live playback, DMX integration. | Cluttered UI, weak undo feedback. |
| Jinx! | Strong effect library, real-time preview. | Busy layout, inconsistent timeline. |
| Pixilart | Friendly pixel workflow, onion skinning. | Not automation/hardware focused. |
| Adobe After Effects | Exemplary timeline interactions, pro theming. | Steep learning curve, heavy. |

## Personas

1. **Lina – Live LED performer**  
   - Goals: tweak animations quickly; preview per-frame.  
   - Pain points: complex navigation, slow scrubbing.

2. **Evan – Motion designer**  
   - Goals: layered timeline, keyboard workflow, dark UI.  
   - Pain points: inconsistent timeline, limited presets, unclear undo.

3. **Mira – Maker/hobbyist**  
   - Goals: simple gradients, hardware preview, sharing.  
   - Pain points: overwhelming panels, unclear export, weak feedback.

## Workflow Highlights

1. Import/create pattern → set matrix → configure layers.  
2. Draw/edit frames via timeline context.  
3. Apply automation actions → preview results.  
4. Save presets → export to hardware/share.  
5. Iterate with history awareness.

## Reference Inspiration

- Timeline: Adobe AE, LottieFiles.  
- Playback controls: Resolume, TouchDesigner.  
- Dark theme: Adobe CC, Figma.  
- Layer inspector: Photoshop.  
- Feedback cues: Blender (tooltips, statuses).
