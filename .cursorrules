# Repository Structure Rules

## IMPORTANT: Dual Repository Setup

This project uses a **dual-repository structure** that MUST be maintained:

### Repository Configuration

1. **Main Repository** (`J-Tech-Pixel-LED---Upload-Bridge.git`)
   - Remote: `origin` → https://github.com/AsithaLKonara/J-Tech-Pixel-LED---Upload-Bridge.git
   - Contains: Root project, `apps/upload-bridge/`, and all other project files
   - **EXCLUDES**: `apps/web-dashboard/` (ignored in `.gitignore`)

2. **License Server Repository** (`J-tech-License-server.git`)
   - Location: `apps/web-dashboard/` (has its own `.git` directory)
   - Remote: `origin` → https://github.com/AsithaLKonara/J-tech-License-server.git
   - Contains: Only the `apps/web-dashboard/` directory contents
   - Used for: Railway deployment

### Critical Rules

1. **NEVER commit `apps/web-dashboard/` to the main repository**
   - The directory is explicitly ignored in `.gitignore`
   - Always work in `apps/web-dashboard/` as a separate repository

2. **NEVER remove the `apps/web-dashboard/` ignore from `.gitignore`
   - This would break the repository separation
   - The ignore rule must remain: `apps/web-dashboard/`

3. **When pushing changes:**
   - Main repo changes: Push to `origin` (main repository)
   - Web-dashboard changes: Navigate to `apps/web-dashboard/` and push to its `origin` (license-server repository)

4. **When committing:**
   - Main repo commits: Commit from root directory (excluding web-dashboard)
   - Web-dashboard commits: Commit from `apps/web-dashboard/` directory

5. **Repository structure must NEVER be changed**
   - Do not modify the dual-repository setup
   - Do not merge the repositories
   - Do not change remote URLs without explicit approval

### File Locations

- Main repository `.gitignore`: Root directory (includes `apps/web-dashboard/` ignore)
- Web-dashboard repository: `apps/web-dashboard/.git/`
- Cursor rules: Root `.cursorrules` and `.cursor/rules/repository-structure.md`

### Remember

**Every time you push or commit:**
- Check which repository you're working in
- Ensure web-dashboard changes go to the license-server repository
- Ensure main project changes go to the main repository
- Verify `.gitignore` still contains `apps/web-dashboard/`
